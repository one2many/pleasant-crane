In the last post, I described the broad relationship between advertisers and audience.  The size and geography of the audience determine the optimal revenue strategies opportunities and impact the size and structure of the publisher's sales force.

### Sustainable Digital Revenue for Publishers

Options available to publishers to achieve sustainable digital revenue can be categorized into Audience revenue and Agency revenue. I make this differentiation because of the natural difference between print and digital advertising.

In legacy media advertising, audience revenue is primary because advertisers want to reach the audience engaged with the news product. Whether it is a coupon in the paper or a special offer on the radio or TV, the advertiser is able to present offers to people that expect and even desire ads.

However, I have not once heard anyone say, "Did you see that ad on the TVnewspaperRadio.com site for $1 off any burger combo?"  It just does not happen.  The audience tolerates ads, but does not expect them to be local or relevant.  Also, the very nature of display ads requires that the reader stops reading and clicks on something that will likely not be as interesting as the article.

With that in mind, we have these broad definitions:

**Audience Revenue** - advertising dollars earned to reach people that view publisher content
**Digital Subscriptions** (potentially);- individual or groups paying to access publisher content
**Agency Revenue** - advertising and marketing dollars earned to reach people while they are not viewing content. The media company is acting as an agent, regardless of the services (provided addressed in part 3 of this series).

#### Audience Revenue

Up until the rise of ad networks, media companies relied almost exclusively on a sales force for digital sales. For legacy advertising products (radio, print, network television), sales people and media buyers still dominate and provide value for local advertisers.  Audience revenue can be broken down into active/sold revenue and passive revenue, defined below.

#### Passive Revenue

Passive revenue is seen by some as ideal because it does not require any effort by the publisher's sales team.  For websites just getting started, passive revenue through ad networks and sponsored 'more from the web' links can generate early revenue.  Similarly, massive sites with huge traffic might rely more on passive revenue as it is nearly impossible to sell enough impressions to fill up the website.  Only a handful of media companies have enough traffic to have to rely solely on ad networks.

Most legacy media companies use a combination of locally sold ads, ad networks, and other types of passive revenue.

For digital audience revenue, the most valuable assets to a local news organization are (in order):

Brand strength of company
Strength of digital presence
Ability to scale
Local sales force
Differentiated digital products/services

Private marketplaces sit in between passive revenue from public networks and revenue sold by a sales person.  For large sites or groups of medium/large sites, the incremental CPM earned from running a private market, or participating in multiple private markets, can provide inventory control and increased revenue opportunities.

#### Audience Revenue Components and Metrics: Online Display

With the ability to have passive revenue from ad network spots along side or in place of sold ad units, online display is probably the most flexible product. Also, online display is the most like the legacy media (print, tv, radio) ad buy, or at least it was until the launch of ad blockers.

For online display, publishers have the following levers to increase revenue:

\*\*Increasing ad positions or adding remnant ads: \*\*Potential to reduce long term revenue sustainability and negatively impact user experience.  There is a tradeoff between user experience and display ad revenue.
**Increase direct CPM and/or reduce ad spots:** requires education and training of both advertisers and sales team, but can lead to increased revenue.  Also requires strong creative and reporting
\*\*Increase average CPM/RPM: \*\*instead of focusing on campaigns, advertisers are sold a mix of sponsorship (share of voice) and impression campaigns to reach an average CPM per page.  This strategy can include remnant ads as well. Offer Non-standard ad units as well as IAB Rising Star ad units will generate a better return for advertisers and more sustainable revenue

#### Audience Revenue Metrics

Online Display & Sponsored Content
The metrics that best aligns audience with revenue are Average Revenue per User (ARPU) and Revenue per Thousand pages (RPM).

#### Promotions: Events, Deals and Contests

For promotions such as deals and contests programs, revenue usually follows the audience.  Therefore, initial success might be judged by list growth, list size, and contest engagement.  After 3 to 6 months, the programs should be evaluated based on average revenue per contest, number and profitability of deals sold.
