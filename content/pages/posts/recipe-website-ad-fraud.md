Ad fraud seems to be everywhere these days. In search of brand-safe content, advertisers and agencies use keyword filters that punish publishers for covering topics that are important to their audiences. Brands are all seeking "brand safe" environments to show their ads. And brand safety tech is flagging news sites as not safe because they write about the Duchess of Sus(sex). So where's the last safe haven for ads? Recipe sites -- probably because there's no chance they will contain words like shooting, blood, or "virus." But not so fast...


Where do these ads end up? What is really considered safe these days? 

### Why are recipes a good fit for ad fraud?

*   Easy to scrape

*   Easy to tweak language and add images

*   Unlikely to be flagged as this is a highly searched topic with tons of duplicate pages and aggregators

*   Easy to create a network of fake sites that iterate over the same recipes

I landed on a rats nest of likely ad fraud when searching for a soup recipe for dinner last night. I ended up making broccoli cheese soup using a recipe from a blog that copied (and referenced) a recipe from food.com. Is this a real site run by an actual person, Christy Denney? Yep! Still, the site has 6 ads for a copy of a recipe that was posted on several other sites.



I mentioned the idea of ad fraud on recipes to[ Augustine Fou. ](www.fouanalytics.com)Searching for the first sentence in the Panera recipe above showed what is going on behind the scenes.



Maybe it is just Panera or broccoli cheese soup, so I tried another recipe - Chilis Baked Potato Soup. Interestingly, the top google result lands on a recipe written by the famous chef, The page is filled with ads to install a chrome extension - not suspicious at all.

This is really quite a disaster.  Google has zero incentive to tweak search algo and a disincentive to adjust the ad serving.
We end up with two levels of ad fraud. The first level of ad fraud is copyright theft. A small blogger manually copying and pasting a recipe is not hurting anyone. But there are perverse incentives to automate and scale this. Create a super fast, seo optimized site.  Scrape recipes, promote socially, and generate ad revenue or try to install extensions.  The second level - create copies of these recipe copies and host them on ad heavy pages with automated bot views.
