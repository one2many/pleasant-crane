"Creative destruction: Newspaper ad revenue continued its precipitous free fall in 2014, and it's likely to continue" from the Carpe Diem blog from the American Enterprise Institute has become famous in the past 5 years for visualizing, albeit in isolation, the decline in newspaper revenue. While these charts show a sharp drop in revenue starting in 2007, there is very little explanation other than print newspaper advertising is failing.

## What is wrong with this perspective?

Historically, newspapers received at least 80%of revenue from advertising. We read about ad revenue drops and newsroom layoffs, with little to no analysis of advertising categories that support the newsroom.

A quick glance at the table below provides some basic insights into what actually happened.

First, starting in 2003–2004 revenue from classified channels (cars, homes, jobs) dropped by a much larger percentage than either retail or national advertising. By 2007, national advertising represented a smaller portion of revenue than other channels.

## What about free content on the Internet?

As evident from the newspaper revenue chart, total advertising revenue for the newspaper industry only dropped 4% from 2000–2006. Digital advertising revenue was not even reported in this format until 2004, but until recently a consortium of newspapers owned several large profitable internet channels including Cars.com, CareerBuilder, and Apartments.com. The newspaper industry has partnered with major internet and advertising companies.

### Revenue Decline: Four Non-Technology Factors

Starting in 2007, newspapers experienced an unpredictable decline in revenue that was largely outside of their control. Unlike many pundits that point to the demise of print and the rise of digital, I believe that this is much bigger than news consumption patterns and that focusing on technology as the culprit is both wrong-headed and detrimental to the prosperity of the industry. This is not to say that digital technology did not impact newspaper revenue, there is simply more to the story.

1.  Financial Crisis in 2008 
    The financial crisis was a catalyst for behavior change among advertisers and subscribers. There has been much written about the sub-prime mortgage and banking collapse, but I believe the broad economic impact is one of the major factors in the decline of newspaper revenue.
    There was an acute impact on classified verticals (cars, homes, jobs) which typically account for 20–40% of advertising revenue. In 2008, auto sales hit a 30-year low and both GM and Chrysler were forced into bankruptcy. Similarly, the only revenue from real estate came from legal foreclosure notices. 
    At the peak of the crisis, all advertising budgets were under the microscope to save cash. Even after the worst was over national advertisers really examined budgets to see where cash could be conserved. In many cases, newspapers did not retain this business.
    The financial crisis reduced credit availability for local businesses to expand, advertise and service customers.

2.  Retail Consolidation
    Retail consolidation and bankruptcy from 1995–2007 (Macys finalized May acquisition in 2006) finally caught up with ad expenditures. Combined with real estate crash and financial crisis, there were now fewer big retailers leading to a drop in national and regional ad dollars. Circuit City, Good Guys, Bullocks, Montgomery Ward, CompUSA are all out of business. Some of the stores were replaced by Costco, Target, or Walmart, while some of the business went online.

3.  Media Consolidation & Finance Capabilities
    After 150 years of profitability, the industry was not prepared to deal with a financial shock just a few years into the growing debt burden from years of newspaper acquisitions funded by debt. Combined with the factors mentioned above, the growth of media technology caused a significant brain drain. Top sales and media executives headed for the exits well before the financial crisis or shift to mobile. If newspapers' sales people were order takers, then the finance departments are filled with bookkeepers. 

4.  It was never (only) about getting news
    Depending on the region and publication, upwards of 30undefined have no interest in receiving coupons in the mail or in the newspaper. While 28undefined wanted coupons in the newspaper. Taken another way, this seems to indicate that 43undefined no coupon + 28% direct mail) get the newspaper only for the news.

### Two Technology Changes that Really Impacted Newspaper Revenue

1.  Mobile - iPhone & Android
    With the launch of the iPhone, digital news became portable and suddenly much less profitable. Before the domination of mobile, the print newspaper still had some value - it was easy to carry. Mobile traffic grew from 10undefined in 4 years, with 1/3 the ads and 1/8 the screen size. In 2018, 60undefined of traffic arrives from a mobile device. Also, competition came not just from other news sources, but also from reduced leisure time with never ending stream of time/mind wasting apps.

2.  Standards Reduce the Power of Suppliers and Create Marketplaces
    The Internet Advertising Board (IAB) sets the guidelines for the advertiser and online publishers. The board of the IAB is comprised of major publishers and advertisers and is analogous to the board for Alliance for Audited Media (the AAM, formerly the Audit Bureau of Circulation). 
    While the standards set by the IAB helped large advertisers by providing a common set of creative that could be used on multiple publications, the standards decreased CPM for publishers and prevented local publishers from charging placement premiums. The evolution from standards to market-based bidding further reduced average CPM and gave advertisers even more reach for the same dollar. To offset decreased CPM, publishers increased the number of ad units per page and negatively impacted user experience.

### Early Internet Leaders

While it is difficult to think back to the dial-up days, it is even more challenging to truly think about the recent past, the internet pre-Google or pre-mobile. Technology was expensive and required capital .Newspapers invested heavily in internet technologies early and were often one of only a handful of companies in a region actually updating a website on a daily basis. So, before dismissing the newspapers as out-of-touch with technology, try to imagine a time before WordPress, before Blogger, before AWS, Azure and Heroku, before BootStrap and Shopify.
